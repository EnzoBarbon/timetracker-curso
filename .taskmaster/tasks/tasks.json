However, this appears to be a task management operation that doesn't require the development tools I have available.\n\nThe user request is asking for an implementation plan for a POST endpoint `/api/clocking-days/:date/clock-in` with specific steps including:\n\n1. Review database model/migration for clocking records table\n2. Create/update ClockingController with clockIn method  \n3. Define API route in backend/routes/api.php\n4. Implement clockIn method with authentication, validation, and business logic\n5. Add tests for single daily clock-in and error handling\n\nBased on the current subtask details and this implementation plan, the new text content to append would be:\n\nImplementation plan includes: 1) Review clocking_days table schema and migration for required clock-in fields, 2) Create/update ClockingController in backend/app/Http/Controllers/ with clockIn method, 3) Define POST /api/clocking-days/{date}/clock-in route in backend/routes/api.php, 4) Implement authentication via Sanctum middleware, date format validation, duplicate clock-in prevention, and success response handling, 5) Add comprehensive tests for single daily clock-in constraint and error scenarios.\n</info added on 2025-06-24T14:28:05.850Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-24T14:32:24.055Z>\nThe POST /api/clocking-days/{date}/clock-in endpoint has been implemented in ClockingController with protected route registered in api.php.
