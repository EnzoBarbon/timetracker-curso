- **Update the Development Log**
  - After completing a significant task or a set of related subtasks, you **must** update the `DEV_LOG.md` file.
  - The log file is located at `[DEV_LOG.md](mdc:DEV_LOG.md)`.

- **What to Document:**
  - **New Features:** Briefly describe any new features that were completed.
  - **Key Decisions:** Record the "why" behind important decisions. For example: "We chose to use Supabase Migrations for schema management to keep it in version control."
  - **Important Information:** Add any critical information that a developer would need to know, such as new test user credentials, environment variables, or complex setup steps.

- **Example Update:**
  ```markdown
  ## Clock-in/Out Functionality
  - **Status:** Completed
  - **Details:** Created the `ClockingController` and API endpoints (`POST /api/clocking-days/{date}/clock-in` and `POST /api/clocking-days/{date}/clock-out`) to handle user time tracking.
  - **Architectural Note:** Implemented validation logic directly in the controller to prevent duplicate clock-ins for the same day. Use this controllers when changing the clock in functionality.
  ```
